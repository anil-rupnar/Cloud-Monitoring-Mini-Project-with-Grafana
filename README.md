# Cloud Monitoring Mini Project with Grafana

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to monitor GitHub and GitLab repositories using Grafana. It provides insights into repository activity, including commits, pull requests, and issues, helping teams better manage their projects.


## Features

- Monitor GitHub and GitLab repositories.
- Visualize metrics such as commits, pull requests, and issues.
- Customizable dashboards to focus on specific metrics.
- Real-time data updates for ongoing project management.

## Technologies Used

- **Grafana**: For visualizing repository metrics.
- **GitHub/GitLab**: Source code management platforms.
- **Cloud Provider**: (AWS) for hosting the virtual machine.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Virtual Machine**:
   - Launch a T2 medium instance on your preferred cloud provider.
   - Ensure that port 3000 is open in your security group.

2. **Connect to the VM**:
   - Use SSH to connect to your instance.

3. **Install Grafana**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   # Follow installation steps based on your OS (download, install, and start Grafana)
